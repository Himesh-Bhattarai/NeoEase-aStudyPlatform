Lu Xun, the protagonist of the story, returns to his hometown after a long absence of more than twenty years. The narrative is infused with a sense of melancholy and reflection as he grapples with the changes that time has wrought upon the place he once called home.

The journey back to his old hometown is marked by cold weather, symbolizing the emotional chill that accompanies revisiting a place filled with memories of youth. As Lu Xun approaches his hometown, he is struck by a sense of disappointment and disconnection. The reality of the town before him is starkly different from the idealized memories he had carried for so long. The once lively and beautiful countryside now appears drab and desolate, devoid of the vibrancy he once imagined.

As Lu Xun boards the boat to leave his old home behind, he grapples with a profound sense of disconnection and isolation. He contemplates the paths of hope and longing, recognizing the fleeting nature of idealized dreams and the harsh realities of existence.

Ultimately, "My Old Home" is a poignant exploration of the human condition, highlighting the tension between cherished memories and the often harsh truths of reality. Lu Xun's journey encapsulates the universal experience of grappling with change, nostalgia, and the passage of time.
