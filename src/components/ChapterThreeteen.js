       <h3 className="s-t">Summary:</h3>
<br />
In "On Libraries," Oliver Sacks reflects on his lifelong relationship with libraries and the transformative impact they had on his intellectual development. He begins by describing his childhood library at home, filled with diverse books curated by his parents, which ignited his love for reading and learning from an early age. Sacks highlights how libraries provided him with a sense of freedom and autonomy in choosing what to explore, contrasting this with the structured and often passive nature of formal education.
<br />
As Sacks grew older, he discovered the joy of public libraries like the Willesden Public Library, where he spent countless hours absorbing knowledge and shaping his own interests. He recounts how access to specialized libraries during his education enabled him to delve deeper into scientific subjects, satisfying his hunger for learning beyond what was available in school libraries.
<br />
The narrative continues as Sacks recounts his experiences in university libraries, particularly the Bodleian and Queen's College library in Oxford, where he encountered rare and ancient texts that expanded his understanding of history and literature. He reflects on the tangible qualities of physical books—their appearance, scent, and weight—that hold sentimental value and enrich the reading experience in ways that digital copies cannot replicate.
<br />
Towards the end of the essay, Sacks laments the shift towards digitalization and the decline of physical book collections in libraries, a trend he views as a loss of cultural heritage and intellectual richness. He mourns the disposal of physical books and treasures the serendipitous discoveries and personal connections facilitated by library browsing.
<br />
Overall, "On Libraries" celebrates the profound influence of libraries on intellectual curiosity and personal growth, emphasizing the enduring value of physical books and the unique role of libraries as communal spaces for exploration, discovery, and connection.
