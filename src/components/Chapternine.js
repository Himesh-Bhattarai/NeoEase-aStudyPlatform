<h3 className="s-t">Summary:</h3>

Dylan Thomas's poem "Every Morning I Wake," taken from his radio play "Under Milk Wood," reflects themes of human vulnerability, the cyclical nature of life, and the hope for divine mercy and protection.
<br />
Vulnerability of Human Life: The poem begins with a humble prayer offered by the speaker every morning upon waking. The speaker acknowledges the transient and fragile nature of life, referring to all creatures as "poor creatures born to die." This emphasizes the vulnerability and mortality inherent in human existence.
<br />
Divine Mercy and Protection: The central theme of the poem revolves around the speaker's plea for divine care and protection. The speaker prays to God to keep His "loving eye" on all beings and to bless the town each evening, acknowledging that survival is uncertain ("whether we last the night or no").
<br />
Human Imperfection: The poem also touches upon the complexity of human nature. The speaker acknowledges that humans are neither wholly good nor bad, but a mixture of both. Despite human flaws, the speaker expresses faith in God's ability to see the best in people ("Thou, I know, wilt be the first / To see our best side, not our worst").
<br />
Cyclical Nature of Life: The concluding lines of the poem reflect the cyclical rhythm of life. The speaker bids farewell to the sun at sunset, acknowledging the temporary nature of goodbyes ("good-bye â€“ but just for now"). This cyclical pattern echoes the broader theme of life's continual renewal and the hope for another day.
<br />
In summary, "Every Morning I Wake" by Dylan Thomas captures the poignant human experience of vulnerability, the longing for divine protection, and the recognition of life's impermanence. The poem's gentle prayerful tone and vivid imagery convey a sense of humility and faith amidst life's uncertainties.
