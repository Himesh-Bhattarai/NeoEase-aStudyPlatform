        Neighbours" by Tim Winton is about a young couple who move into a
        multicultural neighborhood where they initially feel out of place. They
        live between a Macedonian family and a Polish widower. The couple
        struggles to understand their neighbors' customs and behaviors, like the
        Macedonians' loud conversations and the Polish man's odd woodworking.
        <br />
        Over time, the couple tries to connect with their neighbors by gardening
        and building projects. They receive advice and gifts from the neighbors,
        slowly breaking down barriers. As the seasons change, the couple starts

        together to support them. They receive gifts, advice, and encouragement
        from various neighbors, showing kindness despite language differences.

        their baby boy. The young man is moved by the support and connection he
        feels with his neighbors, realizing the value of community over his
        academic pursuits.

        overcome cultural and linguistic differences, bringing people together
        in unexpected ways. It's a heartwarming story about the power of
