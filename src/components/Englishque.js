       <span className="Question">D. Why were the people in the neighborhood surprised at the role of the young man and his wife in their family?</span><br />
        <p className='Answer'>➤ The neighbors were surprised because the young man stayed home to write his thesis while his wife worked, which went against traditional gender roles.

        <p className='Answer'>➤The author's choice to not provide proper names for the characters in the story because  "the young man" and "the young woman" makes it easier for readers from different backgrounds to see themselves in the characters and understand their experiences. This helps everyone feel like they could be part of the story, which makes it more interesting and relatable.   </p> <br />

        <p className='Answer'>➤ Gouvernail was different from Mrs. Baroda's expectations in several ways.

However, upon meeting him, she discovered that he was not very tall, not cynical, didn't wear eyeglasses, and didn't have his hands in his pockets. Despite these differences from her initial impression, she found herself liking him, which puzzled her.   </p> <br />

       <span className="Question">C. How does Mrs. Baroda compare Gouvernail with her husband?  </span><br />
        <p className='Answer'>➤ Mrs. Baroda compares Gouvernail with her husband by noting that Gaston is frank and wordy, while Gouvernail is more reserved and receptive.

        <p className='Answer'>➤  Pelayo and Elisenda imprison the old man in the chicken coop because they initially mistake him for a castaway from a foreign shipwreck and believe he may be dangerous or contagious.

This imagery suggests a gentle and gradual awakening of the day, emphasizing the beauty and tranquility of the sunrise.  </p> <br />

       <span className="Question">B. What does the line ‘The news like squirrels ran’ mean? </span><br />
        <p className='Answer'>➤The line "The news like squirrels ran" means that information or gossip spread quickly and energetically, much like the way squirrels move swiftly and agilely. This metaphor conveys the idea of the rapid dissemination of news or information, adding to the dynamic and lively imagery of the scene.  </p> <br />

       <span className="Question">C. What do you understand by the line ‘The hills untied their bonnets’?  </span><br />

forward?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤   Her back was metaphorically ripped by the old guards as she was advancing forward because they represent the entrenched patriarchal norms and societal pressures that resist change.

Burgos?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤   Julia de Burgos would likely agree with John Donne's statement that "No man is an island entire of itself." Both poets emphasize the interconnectedness of individuals and the importance of community and relationships. While de Burgos focuses more on the liberation of individuals from societal constraints, she also acknowledges the significance of human connections and solidarity in shaping identity and experience. Personally, I agree with both Donne and Burgos, as they offer complementary perspectives on the complexities of human existence and the interdependence of individuals within society. </p> <br />

             <p className='Answer'>➤ He was biased towards the sciences, especially astronomy and chemistry, because these subjects particularly captured his interest and curiosity. His reading was increasingly focused on these areas as he got older, and he sought out books and resources that could satisfy his hunger for knowledge in these fields.   </p> <br />

            <span className="Question">F. Why did he become so fascinated by Hook?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤He became fascinated by Theodore Hook after discovering his now-obscure works in the Bodleian Library at Oxford.

             <p className='Answer'>➤ The library at Queen’s College was a magnificent building designed by Christopher Wren, with an underground maze of heating pipes and shelves holding vast subterranean collections.

             <p className='Answer'>➤  In the 1990s, students began to ignore the bookshelves because they increasingly accessed the information they needed through their computers.

<br />
<br />
<h3 className="QueType">Reference to the context </h3>
             
            <span className="Question"> A. The author says, “I was not a good pupil, but I was a good learner.” Justify it with the textual evidences.</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ The author's statement "I was not a good pupil, but I was a good learner" is justified through several pieces of textual evidence. Firstly, he describes his dislike for the passive nature of school learning: "I disliked school, sitting in class, receiving instruction; information seemed to go in one ear and out by the other." This indicates that traditional classroom settings did not suit his learning style.
<br />
Instead, the author found that he thrived in environments where he could learn actively and pursue his own interests. He spent many happy hours at the Willesden Public Library, where he had "the freedom to select whatever I wanted, to follow paths which fascinated me, to become myself." This self-directed learning allowed him to explore a wide range of subjects at his own pace and in his own way, proving that he was an effective learner outside the confines of a traditional classroom.
<br />
Furthermore, his deep engagement with specific subjects, such as astronomy and chemistry, is evident in his account of obtaining special access to the Science Museum library to read volumes of Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry and Gmelin’s Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry. His intense curiosity and dedication to these fields demonstrate his capacity for deep and self-motivated learning, even if he did not excel as a conventional pupil.  </p> <br />

             
            <span className="Question">b. A proverb says, "Nothing is pleasanter than exploring a library." Does this proverb apply in the essay? Explain.</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ Yes, the proverb "Nothing is pleasanter than exploring a library" applies perfectly to the essay. The author, Oliver Sacks, vividly describes his profound love for libraries and the joy he found in exploring them. His earliest memories include being completely absorbed in books in his family's oak-paneled library, where he would "curl up in a chair and become so absorbed in what I was reading that all sense of time would be lost."
<br />
Moreover, the author recounts his experiences at various libraries throughout his life with great fondness. He speaks of the Willesden Public Library as a place where he received his "real education," roaming the shelves and discovering books that fascinated him. This sense of exploration and serendipitous discovery was a significant part of his learning and personal growth.
<br />
His description of the Queen's College library at Oxford further illustrates the pleasure he derived from exploring libraries. He delighted in handling ancient books and original editions, and the experience of discovering rare and forgotten works, such as those by Theodore Hook, brought him immense joy.
<br />
Overall, the essay encapsulates the essence of the proverb, demonstrating that for Sacks, nothing was more pleasurable or enriching than the act of exploring a library.  </p> <br />

             
            <span className="Question">C. Are there any other services that you would like to see added to the library?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ While traditional libraries already offer a wealth of resources and services, there are several additional services that could enhance their value and accessibility in the modern era: <br />

7. Inclusive Services:  Ensuring accessibility for all patrons by offering services such as braille books, audiobooks, sign language interpretation for events, and accessible facilities.<br />

        <div className="accordion-body">
          <div className="Questions">
            <span className="Question">A. According to the author, what is marriage?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ According to the author, marriage is more than just the union of two individuals; it is a relationship defined by legal, moral, and conventional assumptions. It is an institution that is culturally patterned and integrated into other basic social institutions, such as education, the economy, and politics. Marriage provides structure and organization to the lives of the partners, distinguishing it from other personal affiliations by its established rules and boundaries that influence the behavior of the spouses.  </p> <br /> 

            <span className="Question">B. How is marriage an institution?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ Marriage is an institution because it is a socially established system with defined rules and norms that guide the behavior and expectations of those involved. These rules originate outside the individual unions and establish boundaries around the relationship that influence the partners in many ways. As an institution, marriage integrates into broader societal structures and norms, such as laws, religion, and customs, which reinforce the commitments and obligations of the spouses to each other and their families.  </p> <br />
            <span className="Question">C. What are the rules that a marriage has?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ The rules of marriage include: <br />
            1. The expectation that marriages are entered voluntarily by mature, heterosexual adults. <br />
            2. Husbands are expected to be the principal earners. <br />
            3. Both partners are expected to be sexually faithful. <br />
            4. Married partners are expected to become parents. <br />
            5. These rules create a framework of behavior and responsibilities that distinguish marriage from other types of relationships.  </p> <br />
            <span className="Question">D. Why does marriage matter to men?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤  Marriage matters to men because it provides structure to their lives and helps organize their ambitions. According to Emile Durkheim, marriage restrains unrestrained longings and desires, assigning a definite object to the need for love and creating a state of moral equilibrium. This structure helps men restrict their desires to those permitted within the marriage, providing a sense of duty and happiness in their lot. Marriage, as a social institution, channels and disciplines men's behavior, contributing to their overall well-being and stability. </p> <br />
            <span className="Question">E. What is one of the central problems in modern society?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ One of the central problems in modern society, according to Durkheim, is establishing legitimate boundaries around desires. In advanced societies, basic human necessities are readily available, and desires shift towards well-being, comfort, luxury, and prestige. The challenge is to manage and restrain these desires, which can be accomplished through social institutions like marriage.  </p> <br />
            <span className="Question">F. What does social capital consist of?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ Social capital consists of extensive networks of individuals linked by bonds of trustworthiness and trust. It exists in the relationships among persons and facilitates productive activity by providing networks that channel valued knowledge and information. These networks are sustained by social norms and social sanctions (such as honor and status) that facilitate certain actions and constrain others. Social capital, like physical and human capital, is an important resource that benefits individuals through their relationships within institutions and communities.  </p> <br />
            <span className="Question">G. What is normative marriage? Explain.</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ Normative marriage refers to the traditional ideals and expectations surrounding marriage in society. It is defined by six core dimensions like Marriages are entered voluntarily by mature, heterosexual adults,Husbands are expected to be the principal earners,Both partners are expected to be sexually faithful, Married partners are expected to become parents.
<br />
Although many marriages may deviate from these ideals, they constitute the core of what is considered normative marriage in law, religion, and custom. Normative marriage acts as a form of social control, channeling behaviors and aspirations appropriately and representing the collective sentiments of society. It defines the expectations and responsibilities of married partners, distinguishing marriage from other intimate relationships.  </p> <br />

<p className='Answer'>➤ Yes, marriages differ significantly according to culture. Cultural beliefs, traditions, and social norms shape the practices and expectations surrounding marriage in different societies. Here are a few ways in which marriage practices might differ between my culture (as an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I'll describe a hypothetical cultural scenario) and those in America:
<br />
1. Arranged Marriages: In some cultures, arranged marriages are common, where families play a significant role in selecting a spouse for their children. This contrasts with the American norm of individuals choosing their partners based on personal romantic relationships.
<br />
2. Extended Family Involvement: In many cultures, marriage is not just the union of two individuals but also the joining of two families. The extended family might be heavily involved in the marriage process, from courtship to wedding ceremonies and beyond. In contrast, American marriages tend to focus more on the nuclear family unit.
<br />
3. Wedding Ceremonies: Cultural differences are often most visible in wedding ceremonies. For example, Indian weddings might last several days and include numerous rituals and celebrations, while American weddings are typically shorter, focusing on a single ceremony and reception.
<br />
4. Dowries and Bride Price: Some cultures have the practice of dowries (money or property brought by a bride to her husband on their marriage) or bride prices (money or property paid by the groom to the bride’s family). These practices are not common in America.
<br />
5. Gender Roles: The expectations for gender roles within marriage can differ widely. In some cultures, traditional gender roles are more rigid, with clear expectations for the duties of husbands and wives. While American marriages have increasingly embraced egalitarian views, there are still traditional influences present.
<br />
6. Legal and Religious Contexts: The legal and religious context surrounding marriage can vary. Some cultures have religious laws governing marriage, while in America, marriage is a civil institution that can be accompanied by religious ceremonies depending on personal beliefs.
<br />
By comparing these aspects, we can see that marriage practices are deeply influenced by cultural values and social norms, leading to diverse expressions of this institution worldwide.  </p> <br />

          <div className="Questions">
            <span className="Question">A. What are the factors that contribute to wisdom?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ According to Bertrand Russell, several factors contribute to wisdom: <br />

1. Sense of Proportion:  The ability to consider all important factors in a problem and give each its due weight.<br />
2.Comprehensive Vision:  The capacity to see the broader context and implications of one’s knowledge and actions.<br />
3.Awareness of Human Ends: Understanding the goals and purposes of human life, beyond just acquiring knowledge.<br />
4.Emotional Comprehensiveness:  The integration of intellect with broad, empathetic feelings, rather than having narrow emotions.<br />
5. Emancipation from Prejudices:  The ability to free oneself from personal biases and preconceived notions.<br />
6.Impartiality:  Approaching issues with as much objectivity and detachment from personal interests as possible.  </p> <br />

            <span className="Question">B. What message does the writer try to convey with the example of technicians?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ Russell uses the example of technicians to convey that specialized knowledge can have unintended harmful consequences if it is not combined with wisdom. He illustrates how scientific advancements, like lowering infant mortality rates or discovering atomic energy, can lead to problems such as overpopulation or the creation of nuclear weapons. The message is that without wisdom, the pursuit of knowledge alone can be dangerous and detrimental to society.  </p> <br />

            <span className="Question">C. Which leaders does Russell say were able to mix knowledge and wisdom soundly?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ Russell mentions Queen Elizabeth I of England, Henry IV of France, and Abraham Lincoln as leaders who were able to mix knowledge and wisdom soundly. These leaders, despite living in times of fanaticism and conflict, remained free from the errors of their times and acted with a combination of understanding and practical wisdom.  </p> <br />

            <span className="Question">D. Why is wisdom needed not only in public ways, but in private life equally?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ Wisdom is needed in private life for several reasons: <br />
            A. Choosing Ends to Pursue: Wisdom helps individuals make better choices about their goals and aspirations.
            B. Emancipation from Personal Prejudice: It aids in overcoming personal biases that can cloud judgment.
            C. Avoiding Unwise Pursuits: Wisdom prevents people from wasting their lives on impossible or harmful endeavors, such as the futile search for the philosopher’s stone.
            D. Managing Relationships: It helps in resolving conflicts and fostering harmonious relationships by understanding and mitigating mutual animosities.  </p> <br />

            <span className="Question">E. What, according to Russell, is the true aim of education?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ According to Russell, the true aim of education should be to cultivate wisdom as well as knowledge. Education should teach individuals to integrate their knowledge with a broader, more empathetic understanding of the world, helping them become good citizens of the world. This involves teaching the consequences of hatred and narrow-mindedness and encouraging a comprehensive, objective approach to learning and life.  </p> <br />

            <span className="Question">F. Can wisdom be taught? If so, how?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ Russell believes that wisdom can be taught and should be one of the aims of education. It can be taught by: <br />

            1. Integrating Knowledge with Morals:  Teaching the moral and practical consequences of knowledge.<br />
            2. Emphasizing Broader Surveys:  Supplementing specialized knowledge with broader perspectives on human activities.<br />
            3. Promoting Understanding:  Encouraging the understanding of others and the world, rather than fostering hatred. <br />
            4. Teaching Impartiality:  Helping students approach issues with objectivity and detachment from personal biases.  </p> <br />

            <span className="Question">G. Why does the world need more wisdom in the future?</span><br />
             <p className='Answer'>➤ 
              The world needs more wisdom in the future because as knowledge and skills continue to grow, so does our capacity to realize our purposes, which can lead to greater harm if those purposes are unwise. Greater wisdom is necessary to ensure that the advancements in knowledge and technology are used for the benefit of humanity rather than its detriment. Additionally, in an increasingly interconnected world, the consequences of actions are more far-reaching, making the need for wise, comprehensive decision-making more critical than ever.  </p> <br />

      <div className="Questions">
        <span className="Question">a. Describe the claim of the Chinese nationalists about human history.</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ Chinese nationalists claim that human history began with the Yellow Emperor and the Xia and Shang dynasties. They argue that many of the achievements of Westerners, Muslims, or Indians are merely pale copies of original Chinese breakthroughs.  </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">b. What do pious Muslims believe about human history?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ Pious Muslims believe that all history prior to the Prophet Muhammad is largely irrelevant, and that all history after the revelation of the Quran revolves around the Muslim ummah. They regard their nation's achievements as central to the preservation and spread of Islam's glory.  </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">c. What did the Aztecs firmly believe about the universe?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤The Aztecs firmly believed that without the sacrifices they performed each year, the sun would not rise, and the entire universe would disintegrate. They thought their religious practices were essential to the very laws of physics.   </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">d. What, according to the essay, are the universal human abilities?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ According to the essay, the universal human abilities are morality, art, spirituality, and creativity. These abilities are embedded in our DNA and originated in Stone Age Africa.  </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">e. How are the basic yoga postures derived from the shape of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤  In the essay, a yoga teacher in Israel claimed that the basic yoga postures were derived from the shapes of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. For instance, the trikonasana posture supposedly imitates the shape of the Hebrew letter aleph, and the tuladandasana posture imitates the letter daled. The teacher suggested that Abraham taught these postures to the son of one of his concubines, who then went to India and taught yoga to the Indians. </p> <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="Question">a. How do Hindu nationalists refute the Chinese claim that human history really began with the Yellow Emperor and the Xia and Shang dynasties? Who do you agree with, and why?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤Hindu nationalists refute the Chinese claim by asserting that even airplanes and nuclear bombs were invented by ancient sages in the Indian subcontinent long before Confucius or Plato, not to mention Einstein and the Wright brothers. They cite examples such as Maharishi Bhardwaj inventing rockets and airplanes, Vishwamitra inventing and using missiles, Acharya Kanad being the father of atomic theory, and the Mahabharata describing nuclear weapons accurately.
<br />
As for agreement, it is essential to approach such claims with a critical perspective and rely on historical and archaeological evidence. Both claims highlight cultural pride but often lack substantive proof that aligns with modern scientific understanding. Personally, I do not fully agree with either claim due to the lack of concrete evidence supporting these ancient technological advancements. It's important to appreciate historical contributions from all cultures while also recognizing the limitations of these claims.   </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">b. The author has dealt with a controversial debate on human history. Why do you think history has been a major contested issue in the present world?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ History has been a major contested issue in the present world for several reasons:
          <br />

1. National Identity and Pride: Many nations and cultures take pride in their historical achievements and view them as central to their identity. This can lead to a biased interpretation of history that emphasizes their own contributions while downplaying or ignoring those of others.
<br />

2. Political Power and Legitimacy: Historical narratives are often used to legitimize current political power structures. Leaders and governments may promote a particular version of history to strengthen their authority and justify their actions.
<br />

3. Cultural Superiority: Different groups may claim cultural superiority based on historical achievements, leading to conflicts and disagreements about whose history is more significant or influential.
<br />

4. Educational Influence: The way history is taught can shape the worldview of future generations. Competing narratives can lead to debates about what should be included in school curricula.
<br />

5. Colonial and Post-Colonial Contexts: The legacy of colonialism has left many regions with contentious historical narratives. Former colonial powers and colonized nations often have very different perspectives on their shared history.<br />

6. Modern Globalization: As the world becomes more interconnected, the need for a shared understanding of history becomes more important. However, differing historical interpretations can make it challenging to achieve a unified global perspective.
<br />

Overall, history is a contested issue because it is deeply tied to identity, power, and the way we understand our place in the world. It is essential to approach historical claims with a critical and evidence-based mindset to foster a more inclusive and accurate understanding of the past.  </p> <br />

      <div className="Questions">
        <span className="Question">a. What is the first human rights declaration adopted by the United Nations?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ The first human rights declaration adopted by the United Nations is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly on December 10, 1948.  </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">b. When is Human Rights Day observed?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ Human Rights Day is observed on December 10th every year. It commemorates the day when the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.  </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">c. What is the goal of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤    The goal of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is to establish a common standard of fundamental rights and freedoms for all people, regardless of their nationality, race, religion, gender, or any other status. It aims to promote and protect human dignity, equality, and justice worldwide.</p> <br />
        <span className="Question">d. What are two big stages that involve writing the history of human rights in relation to that of political economy?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ Two significant stages in the history of human rights in relation to political economy are: <br />

1. The heroic age of national welfare states after World War II, during which there was a consensus on the importance of socio-economic rights and a commitment to addressing inequality through state intervention and social policies.
<br />
2. The current era, marked by a transition towards globalization and the dominance of market fundamentalism, where human rights movements face challenges in addressing economic inequality and ensuring distributive justice on a global scale. 
<br /> </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">e. What are the facts that have been missed in Roosevelt’s call for a “second Bill of Rights”?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤  In Roosevelt's call for a "second Bill of Rights," three key facts were often missed. Firstly, it marked America's late entry into an already established North Atlantic consensus on socio-economic protections. Secondly, it understated the egalitarian aspirations of the welfarist movement, which aimed for more than just a basic floor of protection against indigence but also sought to reduce inequality. Thirdly, while Roosevelt hoped for its global adoption, the call envisioned national rather than international implementation.  </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">f. Write the truth expressed in Herodotus’s Histories.</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤  The truth expressed in Herodotus's Histories lies in the story of Solon's encounter with Croesus, where Solon's shaming of Croesus did not bring about his downfall; rather, it was Persian armies that eventually toppled him. This truth highlights the limitations of moral persuasion and the need for substantive action to address inequality and promote justice. </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">g. Why is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights important to you?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is important to me because it serves as a foundational document that articulates the inherent dignity and rights of all human beings. It provides a universal framework for promoting equality, justice, and freedom around the world. As a cornerstone of international human rights law, the UDHR inspires ongoing efforts to protect and uphold human rights, serving as a beacon of hope for those striving for a more just and humane world. </p> <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <span className="Question">a. Does the essay give ways on how to stigmatize inequality? Explain.</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ The essay does not explicitly provide ways to stigmatize inequality. Instead, it discusses the limitations of human rights activism in addressing economic inequality and suggests that a new approach is needed to effectively challenge inequality.  </p> <br /> 
         
        <span className="Question">b. Is another human rights movement necessary? Why?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤  The essay suggests that another human rights movement may be necessary, but it would need to be fundamentally different from current approaches. It argues that the existing human rights movement, while effective in combating political repression and violence, is ill-equipped to address economic inequality and redistribute wealth. Therefore, a new form of human rights movement would need to emerge, one that is capable of challenging the structural causes of inequality and advocating for substantive redistributive policies. </p> <br />

    <div className="Questions">
        <span className="Question">a. Why have Gore and Jitman come to see Laxminarayan?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤Gore and Jitman come to see Laxminarayan to inform him that the bull, Male, has died. They are frightened because they know the king, Ranabahadur Shah, had a strong attachment to the bull and had warned them of severe consequences if anything happened to it. They seek Laxminarayan's guidance and help to deal with the situation and avoid the king's wrath.   </p> <br />

        <span className="Question">b. What, according to cowherds, is the reason behind the death of Male?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ According to the cowherds, Gore and Jitman, Male died because of an inappropriate diet. They mention that the bull, which normally feeds on grass, was given a rich diet of fine rice and lentil soup, which it could not digest. They also highlight the rising costs of food and their own hardships, suggesting that such a lavish diet for the bull was unsustainable and ultimately harmful.  </p> <br />

        <span className="Question">c. Why does Ranabahadur want to see the bull himself?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤  Ranabahadur wants to see the bull himself because he is deeply attached to Male and is concerned about its condition. When Laxminarayan reports that the bull is not moving or eating, the king, suspecting the worst, decides to personally check on the bull to verify its condition. His personal involvement underscores his emotional investment in the bull and his disbelief that it could be seriously ill or dead. </p> <br />

        <span className="Question">d. Why does Laxminarayan run ahead of the convoy at Thulo Gauchar?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ Laxminarayan runs ahead of the convoy at Thulo Gauchar to manage the situation before the king arrives. He wants to prepare the cowherds and ensure they do not reveal the bull's death prematurely. By doing so, he hopes to present the situation in a controlled manner and mitigate the potential fallout from the king's anger, thereby protecting himself and the cowherds from immediate punishment.  </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">e. Why do Gore and Jitman cry when the king declares that Male is dead?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ Gore and Jitman cry when the king declares that Male is dead to show their supposed deep sorrow and devotion to the bull. Their tears are partly genuine fear for their own lives, knowing the king’s threats of severe punishment, and partly a calculated display of grief to evoke the king's sympathy and perhaps mitigate his anger. This emotional display is their attempt to convey loyalty and dedication, hoping it will save them from the king's wrath.  </p> <br />

        <span className="Question">f. How do we learn that the bull is dead?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ We learn that the bull is dead through a combination of the cowherds' descriptions and the king's own observations.

        <span className="Question">h. Write down the plot of the play in a paragraph.</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ "The Bull" by Bhimnidhi Tiwari is a satirical one-act play set in the late eighteenth century, revolving around King Ranabahadur Shah of Nepal and his beloved bull, Male. The play begins with the cowherds, Gore and Jitman, rushing to inform Laxminarayan, the bull doctor, that the prized bull has died. Fearful of the king's wrath, they seek his help to manage the situation. Laxminarayan tries to deceive the king by suggesting a change of climate might revive the bull. However, when the king arrives to see the bull himself, he quickly realizes that Male is dead. The cowherds feign deep sorrow, and Laxminarayan attempts to console the king, who ultimately orders the bull's burial. The play satirizes the feudal system by showcasing the king's irrational attachment to the bull and the extreme measures taken by the characters to appease their ruler, highlighting the absurdities and injustices of the feudal hierarchy.  </p> <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <span className="Question">a. Discuss the late eighteenth-century Nepali society as portrayed in terms of the relation between the king and his subjects as portrayed in the play.</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ In the late eighteenth-century Nepali society depicted in the play, the relationship between the king and his subjects is highly hierarchical and authoritarian. King Ranabahadur Shah wields absolute power, and his whims and desires significantly impact his subjects' lives. The king's obsession with his bull and the extreme measures his subjects must take to appease him illustrate the extent of their subservience and fear. Subjects like Laxminarayan and the cowherds live under constant threat of severe punishment, highlighting the lack of personal agency and the oppressive nature of the feudal system. This dynamic underscores the arbitrary and often capricious use of power by the ruling class, reflecting a society deeply entrenched in feudalism.  </p> <br />

        <span className="Question">b. What does the relation between Laxminarayan and his wives tell us about the society of that time? To what extent has the Nepali society changes since then?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤Laxminarayan's relationship with his wives, marked by neglect and a lack of genuine affection, reflects the patriarchal norms of the time, where women were often treated as secondary and their needs and opinions were disregarded. His derogatory comments and the way he commands them highlight the subjugation and lack of autonomy women experienced. Nepali society has undergone significant changes since then, with increasing awareness and advocacy for gender equality and women's rights. Legal reforms and social movements have empowered women, leading to greater participation in education, employment, and decision-making processes. However, remnants of patriarchal attitudes and gender inequality still persist, indicating an ongoing struggle for true equality.   </p> <br />
        <span className="Question">c. Shed light on the practice of chakari as portrayed in the play. Have you noticed this practice in your society?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤ The practice of chakari, or sycophantic flattery, is prominently portrayed in the play through Laxminarayan's behavior towards King Ranabahadur Shah. Laxminarayan’s constant pandering and exaggerated reverence towards the king reflect a culture where subordinates engage in excessive flattery to gain favor or avoid punishment. This practice underscores the lack of meritocracy and the prevalence of servility in the social hierarchy of that time. In modern Nepali society, while the overt practice of chakari has diminished, elements of it can still be observed in political and bureaucratic contexts, where individuals may resort to flattery or favoritism to secure positions, benefits, or protection, highlighting an ongoing challenge in fostering a culture of integrity and merit.  </p> <br />
         
        <span className="Question">d. How does Laxminarayan outsmart Ranabahadur?</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤  Laxminarayan outsmarts Ranabahadur by cleverly manipulating the king's perception of the situation. When the bull dies, he quickly devises a plan to delay the king's discovery of the truth. He instructs the cowherds to continue caring for the dead bull and pretends that the bull is still alive but unresponsive. He fabricates the idea of moving the bull to a different climate for recovery, knowing that it would buy him time. By playing on the king's ignorance and concern for the bull, Laxminarayan successfully averts immediate punishment, demonstrating his cunning and quick thinking in a desperate situation. </p> <br />

        <span className="Question">e. Sketch the character of Laxminarayan.</span><br />
         <p className='Answer'>➤Laxminarayan is portrayed as a shrewd and resourceful individual, adept at navigating the dangerous dynamics of the feudal system. As a subedar and bichari, he holds a position of some authority but is still subject to the king's whims. He exhibits a blend of fear and cunning, particularly evident in his desperate attempts to conceal the bull's death from King Ranabahadur. Laxminarayan is also shown to be somewhat unscrupulous, willing to lie and manipulate situations to protect himself and his subordinates. Despite his flaws, his actions reveal a deep-seated survival instinct and an ability to think on his feet, traits necessary for survival in the oppressive societal structure of his time.   </p> <br />
